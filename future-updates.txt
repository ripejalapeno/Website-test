Copy ChatGPT prompt to clipboard
  1 - create a 'Generate ChatGPT prompt' button
  2 - forEach through vocabulary array, adding each word to a string list
        called wordsKnown... (e.i. "{hola}, {adios}, {feliz}")
  3 - prompt = `Can you tell me a story in spanish that uses
        words both in and outside of my vocabulary? These are the 
        words I know: {wordsKnown}`
  4 - copy prompt to clipboard

Filter new words before adding them to the vocabulary list
  1 - filter through each character in the word, removing any
        whitespace characters, symbols, and numbers
  2 - if the final word = '', then don't add it to the vocabulary list
  3 - forEach through current vocab - if the new word is already
        in the vocab list, then don't add it

Add translations
1 - store words as objects, with the word itself as the key, and
      the translation as the value
2 - when a new word is added to the vocabulary list, the value is
      undefined, or set as a placeholer like ADD_TRANSLATION
3 - when the vocabulary is rendered to the screen, the value can be
      edited the same as the spanish words

Add Review Page
  Here you can take tests to solidify your knowledge of certain
    translations.
  Each answer either adds or subtracts points dependent on the user's
    answer. The points are stored inside the word object.
  Words to be reviewed are pulled from the vocab list at random, 
    but have a greater chance of appearing the lower that word's
    score is.

Add Vocabulary Page
  This is where all the words will be displayed, and can be edited or
    deleted as desired.

Add Expansion Page
  This will be where the user inputs text to be added to their
    vocabulary
  The ChatGPT prompt option will be on this page as well
  Anything submitted via the form will be displayed on the screen,
    with any unknown words rendered as buttons that let you add
    translations, and get added to the vocabulary list
